****Note - This application is currently under heavy development some features may not work.****


The application you're looking for is a data acquisition tool designed to read serial data from a device and store it in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file format. This functionality is particularly useful for capturing data from various sensors or devices connected via serial communication protocols.

The primary purpose of this application is to facilitate data collection for training and testing machine learning or deep learning models. By capturing the serial data and storing it in a CSV file, you can easily preprocess and analyze the data before feeding it into your models.





## Motivation

Motivated by the need for efficient data collection from custom hardware, I developed Catch Serial. This application eliminates manual entry and conversion, streamlining the acquisition of real-time data into a CSV format. 📊🎣

With Catch Serial, you can focus on exploring and training accurate models using your custom hardware. It frees you from tedious tasks, unlocking insights in machine and deep learning projects. 🚀💡

Experience the power of streamlined data collection with Catch Serial and unleash the potential of your hardware in the exciting world of ML and DL! 💻🔬
